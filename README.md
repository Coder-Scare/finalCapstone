## About the Project

The project was to create a website about a hobby or interest of mine. I decided to base my website off gaming as I currently stream on Twitch. I created a website that gives an overview of my hobby. The website plays a snippet from my live streams, information about myself (to be added), games I am currently playing, schedule and subscription page. 

## Importance of this project
This project brought together the key concecpts of web development. The usage of HTML, CSS and JavaScript was imperative to the completion and synergy of this website. This allowed me to transform the website to become a more dynamic entity. Being able to use all three of these coding languages in synergy is incredibly important and ties all the fundamentals together.

## Installation

To install this project follow the instructions below.
1. Click the green **"code"** button on the top right corner of the page. 
2. A small dropdown menu should appear and here you should click **download zip**.
3. Once installed, **extract** the zip file in a folder of your choice.
4. Once extracted, double click the folder named **"finalCapstone-master"** then double click to open the **index.html** file.
5. Your preferred browser should open up and the website should now be running on your computer.

## How to use

The website should be self explanatory. There is a video on load which you can watch. Navigation bar on the top of the site it always present and clicking the links will take you to the desinated areas of the website. There are some external links that will take you to my twitch channel. Take your time, explore and enjoy!

## Added Features

For task 42 I had to add a **Save for later** feature. When you click the button named *save this* it will alert you of have many items you have saved and save it to a new webpage called saved. This feature is experimental and may be used in a different capacity when the website is fully developed. The other new feature added is the **like** feature. On click the feature changes the color of the heart from white to red. Acts similar to a like feature on instagram but it does not save your like to session storage or local storage or even a server.
