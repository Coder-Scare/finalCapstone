Task: Create a save for later page for my website. 
This functionality should save articles, images etc
in a folder for the user to come back to and view later.


Steps to accomplish this:
1. Add an option on images and articles on my website to enable you to
add them to save later folder??? [DONE]

user to see what is in their folder.

[Similar to a add to cart functionality in a website -
But we are calling this save for later]

****************************************************************
-Make use of session or local storage to accomplish this.
- Add a save button below desire images and text [DONE]
- Create and call a function that looks for the item in html, 
gets the items details, push it to an array and save that array within
session storage. 
- Go to save page and obain the array from session storage, 
iterate through it, then rebuild page with content within session storage.

Use multiple keys in sessionStorage to account for this.
One key to save the array of items you want to save
2nd key keep track of how many items have been added, 
counter that as you click on save for later it increments by 1
alerts the current value and saves back into sessionStorage
[Both saved to sessionStorage]
